    <p id="p1">In 2005, Morgan signed with Rocketown Records. The company released his debut album in the United States, but four of the original songs were removed in favour of cover versions of Hillsong songs written by Morgan. In addition, the remaining songs were remixed and the resulting songs had a heavier feel when compared to the softer pop-rock originals.

        Morgan has toured extensively around the United States, Canada and Europe. A 2007 European tour featured events in Scotland, England, Germany and Sweden.[3] Everyone, contains Morgan's interpretation of his music and was mostly written in the previous 18 months, recorded in a big sounding, studio worship without the congregational elements found in the Hillsong Live albums.[4] Everyone largely featured covers of previously released Hillsong songs written by Morgan and was released in Australia on 2 October 2006.
        
        Morgan officially became Hillsong's new worship pastor in 2008, succeeding Darlene Zschech, however, Zschech continued to be a worship leader of the Hillsong Worship Team until 2012. On 29 June 2010, Hillsong Live released A Beautiful Exchange, an album featuring songs by Morgan. Morgan led Hillsong's 2010 tour of the United States, which kicked off on 21 July and included events in Dallas, Detroit and Los Angeles.[5][6]

                    In 1980, when Zschech was 15, her father rededicated his life to Christ and began taking her to church, where she also became a committed Christian and met her future husband, Mark Zschech.[6] When they married, her husband suggested that they move from Brisbane to Sydney, which was confirmed at a small church they were visiting one Sunday when the guest speaker said in the middle of his sermon, "This doesn't happen to me very often, but whatever it is you two prayed last night, God says to do it now."[7] They began attending Hills Christian Life Centre, which would become Hillsong Church.

I grew up with a bunch of teenagers and they started getting saved into what has become the Hillsong Church and eventually I went along and that was it."[4] He was on the team, led by Brian Houston, that pioneered the Hills Christian Life Centre (later part of Hillsong Church) in August 1983.[4] Aside from Bullock and Houston the initial pastors were Pat Mesiti, Mike Murphy, Donna Quinn and Michael Smith.[5]:‚Ää26‚Ää Bullock was appointed the worship pastor for Hillsong Church in Sydney and was the convenor of their annual conferences from 1987 to 1995. Tanya Levin described him in her book People in Glass Houses: An insider's story of a life in and out of Hillsong (2007) writing that "[he] was our Piano Man. Short and stock, with blue eyes that pierced you like laser beams."[5]:‚Ää40‚Ää
